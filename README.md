# impractical-hackers-submission

This is our submission to the Impractical Hackers Hackathon by MLH

The project is based on the Wheel of Doom depicted on the television series 'Impractical Jokers'

It is hosted on github pages for trying it out.

Basically it is a random class picker (inspired by the Coding Train) that spins and gives a random impractical task to perform alongwith the task link.

Built using the p5.js library and it also has support for arduino(the .brd and .ino files)
